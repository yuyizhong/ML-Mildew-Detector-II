# Dashboard Design for user interface

## Page 1: Project Summary

    - Quick project summary providing background information about the project and its importance.
    - General information about the problem and the available dataset.
    - Business requirements

## Page 2: Cherry Leaf Visualizer

Addressing Business Requirement 1: Differentiating healthy cherry leaves from powdery mildew.
Components:

    - Show average and variability images for each class (healthy and powdery mildew).
    - Display the differences between average healthy and average powdery mildew cherry leaves.
    - Create an image montage for each class.

Visual representations of the average images, differences, and image montages for better understanding.

## Page 3: Cherry Leaf Health Detection

Addressing Business Requirement 2: Predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
Components:

    - Link to download a set of cherry leaf images for live prediction (from the provided dataset).
    - User Interface with a file uploader widget for uploading multiple cherry leaf images.
    - Display of uploaded images and prediction statements (healthy or powdery mildew) with associated probabilities.
    - A table showing the image name and prediction results.
    - Download button to download the prediction results.

## Page 4: Project Hypothesis and Validation
    - Provides information on project hypotheses and their validation.
    - Separate blocks for each hypothesis with conclusions and validation details.

## Page 5: Model Performance Metrics
    - Display of machine learning model performance metrics.
    - Label frequencies for the train, validation, and test datasets.
    - Model history showing accuracy and loss curves during training.

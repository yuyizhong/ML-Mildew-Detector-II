    __General info__
    * Powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop from Farm & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew.
    * The manual verification if a given cherry tree containing powdery mildew takes 30 minutes per employee in each tree.
    * The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not time efficient.
    * To solve this problem, the ML system is developed to detect instantly, using a leaf tree image, if a cherry leave is healthy or has powdery mildew.
